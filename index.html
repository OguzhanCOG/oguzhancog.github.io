							<h2>OCT 2018: Proxmox Homelab</h2>
							<p>Always a hardware enthusiast since childhood, my custom homelab is where all my projects have taken shape. A digital powerhouse designed to accelerate innovation and elevate my home's tech ecosystem. Anchored by a Dell PowerEdge R740 (2x Xeon Platinum 8160, 1536GB DDR4, 200TB of HDDs in RAID10) for GAN and LLM training, an older R720 for Docker environments and model inference, and an embedded Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W as a quorum device, it perfectly showcases my other strength; expertise in hardware and enterprise-level networking.</p>

							<h2>APR 2017: TypoDetectFX</h2>
							<p>TypoDetectFX is a custom 7-layer FCNN initially developed to test PyTorch for typo detection with direct mappings to output indexes. Over time, it evolved into a safety mechanism for large LLMs and free-entry text prompts, classifying inputs into categories like Normal, Reserved, NSFW, Illegal, and Legal. The system uses a bitwise ASCII string for input, outputting to 8 neurons. Specific inputs trigger safety flags, and probability ranges are handled via a bell curve approximation for suspect inputs. The latest iteration of the model for my A-Level NEA converged quickly, and its final weights were trained on an RTX 2060 SUPER.</p>

							<h2>EPQ: Training a super-resolution AI model from scratch (A)</h2>
							<p>For my EPQ, I developed a custom neural network framework featuring convolutional layers, attention mechanisms, the Adam optimizer, and a bespoke backpropagation algorithm. I used this framework to create a GAN trained on artificially degraded image pairs, which later inspired the development of NWCustom and later iterations of EnhanceFX™ (including V and VI). The EPQ paper details model mechanisms, dataset improvement techniques, and empirical training data. The final presentation included a live demo on my laptop while answering questions on demand, and earned an A, just 2 marks short of an A* (FINISH: NOV 2023).</p>

							<h2>CultureHack2024: Tajdeed</h2>
							<p>On 20th November, 2024, our group, “.com”, designed and implemented a frontend and backend system for the CMCI department in under 5 hours. The project integrated a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS, with a Python, Flask, and PyTorch backend, and a clean CSS-styled UI. My NeuralFusionII (8b version) architecture generated real-time course summaries from database entries. Had to overcome self-attention and token over-generation issues with hyper-parameter tuning. The database was hosted on AWS, which ensured scalability. Expertise in ML (myself & <a href="https://github.com/Vinuitik">Dmytro</a>), databases (<a href="https://github.com/Vinuitik">Dmytro</a> & myself), and web development (<a href="https://github.com/MehB06">Mehdi</a> & Connor).</p>

							<h2>TI4 & Imperial College London: DeathBot</h2>
							<p>From the 11th to the 13th of October, 2024, at Imperial College London, our team developed a death bot that tracks human targets using a pre-trained, edge-detection CNN on a Raspberry Pi 5. The bot featured a large metal ruler mounted to a geared motor, enhancing its intimidation factor. The project was completed over a weekend with strong collaboration, showcasing innovation and rapid execution in a challenging environment.</p>

							<h2>THERE IS MORE...</h2>
							<p>My goal with this portfolio is to give others a quick look at what I do and what I’ve accomplished. It doesn’t cover all 70+ of my projects, though!</p>
							<p>I prefer to highlight my best work and dedicate the lower half of the portfolio to **documented** hackathons (including Tech Arena 2024) – something I only started doing not too long ago. I hope you have enjoyed reading about my projects!</p>
